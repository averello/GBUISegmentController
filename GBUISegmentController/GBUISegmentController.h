 @brief The protocol a segment controller delegate should respect.
 @details You use the @a GBUISegmentControllerDelegate protocol when you want to augment the behavior of a segment controller. In particular, you can use it to determine whether specific segmnets should be selected or to perform actions after a segment is selected. After implementing these methods in your custom object, you should then assign that object to the delegate property of the corresponding @ref GBUISegmentController object.
 All of the methods in this protocol are optional.
